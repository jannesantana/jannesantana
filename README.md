- Hey! I'm Janne, a PhD student at CYU on active matter systems. I'm currently working on several aspects of collective motion, 
from rod-shaped twitching bacteria to low-dimensional systems. 📖🦠🐑
- I'm also interested in all aspects of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and theoretical physics in general. :atom:
- You can reach me by email janne-cristine.de-melo-santana@cyu.fr or even by Instagram or threads on @jannecristine ⭐🖤
