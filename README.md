- Hey! I'm Janne, a former PhD student at CYU on active matter systems. My projects involved working on several aspects of collective motion, 
from bacteria dynamics to phase transitions low-dimensional systems. I'm also interested in all aspects of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and theoretical physics in general. :atom:📖🦠🐑
- In additional, I am very interested in computational and quantitative tools in general (modeling, simulations, data analysis) to solve complex real world problems.
- You can reach me by email jannecristine@gmail.com.
