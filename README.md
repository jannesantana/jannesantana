- Hey! I'm Janne, a former PhD student at CYU on active matter systems. My projects involved working on several aspects of collective motion, 
from rod-shaped twitching bacteria to phase transitions low-dimensional systems. 📖🦠🐑
- I'm also interested in all aspects of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and theoretical physics in general. :atom:
- In addition, I am also interested in applying the same tools used in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and simulations techniques to quantitative finance problems.
- You can reach me by email jannecristine@gmail.com or even by Instagram or threads on @jannecristine ⭐🖤
